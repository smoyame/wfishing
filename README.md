# Journal Tracker
`For webfishing as of v1.1.`

Real close to getting that last diamond. Made this tracker to have fun with Webc templating in 11ty. Anything to stop unnecessary bloat.

## Want to add:
* Filter by quality tier for need-to-catch fish
* Progress bar for each quality tier
* "Download" and "upload" journal progress (in case you go play on a different computer)
	* Or doing this in custom link form?

## If there's time:
* Add notes about recommended bait for each fish.
	* Citations would be so cool. We love appreciating our dutiful community members.
