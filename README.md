# Journal Tracker
`For webfishing as of v1.1.`

Made to indulge my need to people-watch and read chatlogs instead of opening up my journal in-game, or hoarding browser tabs.

Real close to getting that last diamond. Also, made this tracker to have fun with Webc templating in 11ty.


## Want to add:
* Filter by quality tier for need-to-catch fish
* Progress bar for each quality tier
* "Download" and "upload" journal progress (in case you go play on a different computer)
	* Or doing this in custom link form?

## If there's time:
* Add notes about recommended bait for each fish.
	* Citations would be so cool. We love appreciating our dutiful community members.
